# Skip-List
My implementation of Skip lists in Python, with the ability to add/delete multiple nodes at once, at which layer they should be added to and to print the whole datastructure using pandas dataframes. It also uses matplotlib to plot the number of comparisons/runtimes (if you used the second testsuite) for each iteration

To test my program, you will need:
- Numpy (pip install numpy)
- Pandas (pip install pandas)
- Matplotlib (pip install -U matplotlib)
